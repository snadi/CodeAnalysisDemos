# About

This repo contains a bunch of demos related to tools for analyzing source code. These are simple tools & use cases just to demonstrate available options and how to get started.

The demos are prepared by [Sarah Nadi](https://sarahnadi.org) and are mainly used in CMPUT 663 at the University of Alberta.

# Running the Demos

The repo comes with a Dockerfile that takes care of using the correct version of Java and setting up dependencies, including compiling the various projects into jar files to use.

To build the Docker image (this may take a bit of time):

```
docker build --tag=ca-demo:f23 .
```

To run the docker image:

```
docker run --name CADemo -it --rm ca-demo:f23 /bin/bash
```

Unless otherwise specified, all instructions below are based on running from within the Docker image (which means that all most code for the demos has been compiled already)

## Using JDT for AST Processing

We use the Eclipse JDT APIs to process the AST of corresponding code. The `MethodInvPrinter` prints out all invocations found in `resources/test-inv.java`. The `MethodiInvocationCounter` counts how many times each method is called. `VarDeclCounter` prints out all declarations found in `resources/test.java`.

```
/ca-demo# cd ASTDemos/
/ca-demo/ASTDemos# java -cp target/AST_JDT-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar MethodInvPrinter
test:
	st_test.indexOf(["ell"])
	st_test.substring([2, 4])
test2:
	arrayList.add(["Hello"])
	arrayList.add([1, "World"])
	arrayList.get([0])
	testStr.substring([2, 4])

/ca-demo/ASTDemos# java -cp target/AST_JDT-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar MethodInvocationCounter
add is called 2 times
indexOf is called 1 times
substring is called 2 times

/ca-demo/ASTDemos# java -cp target/AST_JDT-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar VarDeclCounter
Declaration of 'i' at line2
Declaration of 'j' at line3
Declaration of 'al' at line4
```


## GumTreeDiff Demo

[GumTree](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree) can analyze two versions of a piece of code, map nodes from one version to the other, and detecte the change operations that occurred. The current demo simply prins the edit actions that occurred between programs `examples/Version1.java` and  `examples/Version2.java`

## BOA Demo

Not part of the Docker container

Boa homepage is [http://boa.cs.iastate.edu](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu) and contains all necessary documentation. You need an account to run queries.

1. View the example at [http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/examples/index.php#null-check](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/examples/index.php#null-check)
2. Run the example on the small dataset (so it finishes quickly)
3. Go to your list of jobs to view the result
